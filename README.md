# CPAY - Decentralized Point-of-Sale System on Aptos

![CPAY Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/300x100/4A90E2/FFFFFF?text=CPAY)

## Overview

CPAY is a revolutionary DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) project built on the Aptos blockchain that transforms traditional point-of-sale systems. Our solution combines the security of hardware wallets with the convenience of QR-code based payments, creating a seamless and secure payment experience for merchants and customers.

## üöÄ Features

### For Merchants
- **Custom QR Code Generation**: Create dynamic QR codes for specific payment amounts and assets
- **Hardware Wallet Integration**: Built-in hardware wallet functionality keeps merchant assets secure
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Accept various cryptocurrencies and tokens on the Aptos ecosystem
- **Real-time Transaction Monitoring**: Instant confirmation of payments
- **Offline Capability**: Generate QR codes even without internet connectivity

### For Customers
- **Simple Scan-to-Pay**: Just scan the QR code and approve the transaction
- **Multi-Wallet Compatibility**: Works with popular Aptos wallets
- **Instant Settlement**: Transactions settle directly on-chain
- **Transaction History**: Complete payment records on the blockchain

### Security Features
- **Hardware Wallet Security**: Private keys never leave the secure hardware environment
- **Signal Bus Protection**: Data transmission occurs through dedicated signal buses
- **No Signal Interception**: Proprietary communication protocol prevents eavesdropping
- **Air-Gapped Operations**: Critical operations can be performed offline

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Hardware Components
- **Secure Element**: Stores private keys and performs cryptographic operations
- **Display Module**: Shows QR codes and transaction information
- **Signal Bus Interface**: Secure communication channel with merchant systems
- **Network Module**: Optional connectivity for real-time updates

### Software Stack
- **Aptos Smart Contracts**: Handle payment processing and validation
- **QR Code Generator**: Creates dynamic payment requests
- **Hardware Wallet SDK**: Interfaces with the secure hardware
- **Merchant Dashboard**: Web-based management interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Aptos
- **Smart Contracts**: Move Language
- **Hardware**: Custom POS terminal with secure element
- **Communication**: Proprietary signal bus protocol
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for non-sensitive data)

## üì± How It Works

### Payment Flow
1. **Merchant Action**: Merchant enters payment amount and selects asset type
2. **QR Generation**: Hardware POS generates a unique QR code containing payment details
3. **Customer Scan**: Customer scans QR code with their Aptos wallet
4. **Transaction Creation**: Wallet creates transaction based on QR data
5. **Blockchain Settlement**: Transaction is submitted to Aptos blockchain
6. **Confirmation**: Both merchant and customer receive confirmation

### Security Protocol

```

## üîß Installation

### Hardware Setup
1. Connect CPAY POS terminal to merchant system via signal bus
2. Initialize secure element with merchant wallet
3. Configure network settings (optional)
4. Test QR code generation

### Software Integration
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cpay.git

# Install dependencies
cd cpay
npm install

# Configure Aptos network
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Deploy smart contracts
npm run deploy

# Start the application
npm run start
```

## üìã Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- CPAY POS Terminal
- Signal bus compatible merchant system
- Display for QR code visualization
- Network connection (optional for real-time features)

### Software Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- Aptos CLI
- Compatible Aptos wallet for customers

## üîê Security Considerations

- **Private Key Management**: Keys are generated and stored in secure hardware
- **Communication Security**: All data travels through encrypted signal buses
- **Transaction Integrity**: Smart contracts validate all payment parameters
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history maintained on-chain
